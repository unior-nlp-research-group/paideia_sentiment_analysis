GENERAL DESCRIPTION
-------------------

The NRC Emotion Lexicon is a list of English words and their associations with eight emotions
(anger, fear, anticipation, trust, surprise, sadness, joy, and disgust) and two sentiments
(negative and positive). The annotations were manually done through crowdsourcing.

This work was approved by the NRC Research Ethics Board (NRC-REB) under protocol number
2009-94. REB review seeks to ensure that research projects involving humans as
participants meet Canadian standards of ethics.

Companion lexicons -- the NRC Emotion Intensity Lexicon and the NRC VAD Lexicon are available here:
http://saifmohammad.com/WebPages/lexicons.html

Applications: The lexicon has a broad range of applications in Computational Linguistics, Psychology,
Digital Humanities, Computational Social Sciences, and beyond. Notably it can be used to:
- study how people use words to convey emotions.
- study how emotions are conveyed through literature, stories, and characters.
- obtain features for machine learning systems in sentiment, emotion, and other affect-related tasks and
  to create emotion-aware word embeddings and emotion-aware sentence representations.
- evaluate automatic methods of determining emotion intensities (using lexicon entries as gold/reference scores).
- study psychological models of emotions.
- study the role of emotional words in emotional sentences, tweets, snippets from literature.


PYTHON CODE TO ANALYZE EMOTIONS IN TEXT
---------------------------------------

There are many third party software packages that can be used in conjunction with the NRC
Emotion Lexicon to analyze emotion word use in text. We recommend Emotion Dynamics:

https://github.com/Priya22/EmotionDynamics

It is the primary package that we use to analyze text using the NRC Emotion Lexicon and
the NRC VAD Lexicon.  It can be used to generate a csv file with a number of emotion
features pertaining to the text of interest, including metrics of utterance emotion
dynamics. 


NRC EMOTION LEXICON IN VARIOUS LANGUAGES
----------------------------------------

The NRC Emotion Lexicon has affect annotations for English words. Despite some cultural
differences, it has been shown that a majority of affective norms are stable across
languages. Thus, we provide versions of the lexicon in over 100 languages by translating
the English terms using Google Translate (August 2022).

The lexicon is thus available for English and these languages:

Afrikaans, Albanian, Amharic, Arabic, Armenian, Azerbaijani, Basque, Belarusian, Bengali,
Bosnian, Bulgarian, Burmese, Catalan, Cebuano, Chichewa, Corsican, Croatian, Czech,
Danish, Dutch, Esperanto, Estonian, Filipino, Finnish, French, Frisian, Gaelic, Galician,
Georgian, German, Greek, Gujarati, HaitianCreole, Hausa, Hawaiian, Hebrew, Hindi, Hmong,
Hungarian, Icelandic, Igbo, Indonesian, Irish, Italian, Japanese, Javanese, Kannada,
Kazakh, Khmer, Kinyarwanda, Korean, Kurmanji, Kyrgyz, Lao, Latin, Latvian, Lithuanian,
Luxembourgish, Macedonian, Malagasy, Malay, Malayalam, Maltese, Maori, Marathi, Mongolian,
Nepali, Norwegian, Odia, Pashto, Persian, Polish, Portuguese, Punjabi, Romanian, Russian,
Samoan, Sanskrit, Serbian, Sesotho, Shona, Simplified, Sindhi, Sinhala, Slovak, Slovenian,
Somali, Spanish, Sundanese, Swahili, Swedish, Tajik, Tamil, Tatar, Telugu, Thai,
Traditional, Turkish, Turkmen, Ukranian, Urdu, Uyghur, Uzbek, Vietnamese, Welsh, Xhosa,
Yiddish, Yoruba, Zulu

Note that an earlier version included translations obtained in 2017. The current 2022
translations are markedly better. That said, some of the translations may still be incorrect
or they may simply be transliterations of the original English terms.

FORMS OF THE LEXICON
--------------------

1. Annotations at word level (file: NRC-Emotion-Lexicon-Wordlevel-v0.92.txt)

The word-level lexicon was created by taking the union of emotions associated with all the
senses of a word (see form 4). This is the primary form of the lexicon, and is used by the vast majority of users.

2. Translation of the lexicon into over 100 languages (file: NRC-Emotion-Lexicon-ForVariousLanguages.txt)

3. Annotations at word-sense level (file: NRC-Emotion-Lexicon-Senselevel-v0.92.txt)

The original lexicon has annotations at word-sense level. Each word-sense pair was
annotated by at least three annotators (most are annotated by at least five). 


FILE FORMAT 
-----------

1. NRC-Emotion-Lexicon-Wordlevel-v0.92.txt: Annotations at WORD LEVEL. This is the primary
lexicon file used by the vast majority of users.

Each line has the following format:
<term><tab><AffectCategory><tab><AssociationFlag>

<term> is a word for which emotion associations are provided;

<AffectCategory> is one of eight emotions (anger, fear, anticipation, trust, surprise,
sadness, joy, or disgust) or one of two polarities (negative or positive);

<AssociationFlag> has one of two possible values: 0 or 1. 0 indicates that the target word
has no association with affect category, whereas 1 indicates an association.


2a.  NRC-Emotion-Lexicon-ForVariousLanguages.txt: This file has the same first
eleven columns as the NRC-Emotion-Lexicon-Wordlevel-v0.92.txt.  Additionally, it has columns
pertaining to over 100 languages. Each of these columns lists the translations of the
English words into the corresponding language. For example, the column Japanese contains
the Japanese translations of the English words.  The translations were obtained using
Google Translate in August 2022.


2b. OneFilePerLanguage: This directory has the same information as in
NRC-Emotion-Lexicon-ForVariousLanguages.txt, but in multiple files -- one for
each language.  Each of these files has twelve columns. The first eleven columns are the same as in
NRC-Emotion-Lexicon-ForVariousLanguages.txt. Additionally, it has  a column for the translation
of the English words to a different language -- the language corresponding to the file
name.  So if one is interested only in the Japanese version of the lexicon, then they can
simply use Japanese-NRC-EmoLex.txt.


3. NRC-Emotion-Lexicon-Senselevel-v0.92.txt: Annotations at WORD-SENSE LEVEL.

Each line has the following format:
<term>--<NearSynonyms><tab><AffectCategory><tab><AssociationFlag>

<term> is a word for which emotion associations are provided;

<NearSynonyms> is a set of one to three comma-separated words that indicate the sense of
the <term>. The affect annotations are for this sense of the term.

<AffectCategory> is one of eight emotions (anger, fear, anticipation, trust, surprise,
sadness, joy, or disgust) or one of two polarities (negative or positive);

<AssociationFlag> has one of two possible values: 0 or 1. 0 indicates that the target word
has no association with affect category, whereas 1 indicates an association.

4. ListOfLanguages-For-Which-Lexicon-Availabale.txt: Lists the languages for which the
lexicon is available.

5. Paper1_NRC_Emotion_Lexicon.pdf and Paper2_NRC_Emotion_Lexicon.pdf: The research papers describing the NRC Emotion Lexicon.

6. Paper-Practical-Ethical-Considerations-Lexicons.pdf: Practical and Ethical Considerations in the
Effective use of Emotion and Sentiment Lexicons

ENCODING: The lexicon files were created using UTF-8 encoding. You can view the lexicon files using
most text editors, Microsoft Excel, etc. You might have to make sure that the viewer
supports characters from various languages, i.e., set the encoding option in the viewer to
UTF-8, etc.  For example, to view in excel, follow these steps:

- open excel
- click on File -> Import
- select file type as 'Text file'
- select the lexicon file to import in the dialog box that opens up
- select 'File Origin' type as 'Unicode (UTF-8)'
- click 'Finish'


VERSION INFORMATION
-------------------

Version 0.92 is the latest version as of 10 July 2011. This version has annotations for
more than twice as many terms as in Version 0.5. The automatic translations generated
using Google Translate are updated every few years. Translations to other languages
were last obtained in August 2022.


OTHER EMOTION LEXICONS
----------------------

- The NRC Emotion Intensity Lexicon is a list of English words (taken from the NRC Emotion
Lexicon and other sources) with real-valued scores of intensity for eight discrete emotions
(anger, anticipation, disgust, fear, joy, sadness, surprise, and trust).

- The NRC Valence, Arousal, and Dominance (VAD) Lexicon includes a list of more than 20,000 English words and
their valence, arousal, and dominance scores.  For a given word and a dimension (V/A/D), the scores range from
0 (lowest V/A/D) to 1 (highest V/A/D).

Ethical Considerations
----------------------

Please see the papers below (included with the download) for ethical considerations
involved in automatic emotion detection and the use of emotion lexicons. (These also act
as the Ethics and Data Statements for the lexicon.)

Saif M. Mohammad. Computational Linguistics. 48 (2): 239â€“278. June 2022.

Note that the labels for words are *associations* (and not denotations). As noted in the
paper above, they are limited by when the dataset was annotated, by the people that
annotated them, historical perceptions, and biases. (See bullets c through h in the
paper). It is especially worth noting that identity terms, such as those referring to
groups of people may be particularly prone to inappropriate biases. Further, marginalized
groups have historically faced more negative perceptions. Thus some terms that are
associated with marginalized groups may be marked as having associations with negative
emotions by the annotators. For example, group X marked as being associated with negative
emotions could imply that they have historically faced negative emotions or that some
people have negative associations with group X, or there is some other reason for the
negative association. The exact relationship is not listed in the lexicon. In order to
avoid misinterpretation and misuse, and as recommended generally in the ethical
considerations paper, we have removed entries for a small number of terms (about 25) that
are associated with identity groups. For the vast majority of sentiment and emotion
analysis requirements this removal will likely have no impact or will be beneficial.

The list of identity terms used is taken from this list developed in 2019 on an offensive
language project (abusive language is often directed at some identity groups):

https://github.com/hadarishav/Ruddit/blob/main/Dataset/identityterms_group.txt

Only some of these terms occurred in our lexicon. This is not an exhaustive list; users
may choose to filter out additional terms for their particular task. We also welcome
requests for removal of additional terms from the list. Simply email us with the term or
terms and reason for removal.
